# songer

- In this application I have :
1. `/hello` : Write it after the `localhost:8080` , And you will see greeting message.
- Ex: `localhost:8080/hello`  ==> Will go to a greeting page.

2. `/capitalize/message` If you enter this route, it will get back an HTML page containing the response with capetalizing the message.
- Ex: `/capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized`  ==> `THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED`

3. `/albums` It will show you the albums in this route. An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that albumâ€™s art.
